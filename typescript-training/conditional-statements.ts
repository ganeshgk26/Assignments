//Conditional Statements : Writing conditions along with statements. 
// So whenever Node.js is going to run the statement, first it is going to check the condition. If the condition satisfies, then only it is going to run the statement. 

// There are two different types of conditional statements. 

//1. if...else statement ==> When we don't know the result of condition before execution.
//2. switch statement ==> When we know the result of condition before execution.Now, we want to choose one option among multiple

// 1. nested if...else statement ==> if...else statement inside another if...else statement.
